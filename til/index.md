# Today I learned!

Like most people, I tend to learn a little bit of something everyday. More often than not, these tend to be from a hodgepodge of sources that range from elegant computation theory to arcane shell wizardry. The downside of this is that every now and then I feel unproductive if I don't conjure up some corporeal, tangible amalgamation of whatever I learnt during the day. Quite frankly, that's an impossible goal to strive
towards but my primieval brain seems to think otherwise.[^1]

I thought that if I documented whatever my bouts of procrastination produced I would feel a little less annoyed
at myself for getting distracted. Everything here has been cultivated for my own pleasure, outside of working hours. Hope you find something interesting!

[10] Initial commit? Today was a bit of a low level day. I learnt about the foreign function interface capabilities of
both OCaml and Rust.[^2][^3] I was interested in the Unix filesystem so I looked through how file tables were organized -- looked like it's linked lists all the way down. Finally, I read the paper (?) that lays the groundwork for the *kqueue(2)* event notification system [^4] and I dabbled a little bit into using ARM assembly to make syscalls!
