More often than not, these tend to be from a hodgepodge of sources that range from elegant computation theory to arcane shell wizardry. The downside of this is that every now and then I feel unproductive if I don&#39;t conjure up some corporeal, tangible amalgamation of whatever I learnt during the day. Quite frankly, that&#39;s an impossible goal to strive towards but my primieval brain seems to think otherwise.</p> <p>I thought that if I documented whatever my bouts of procrastination produced I would feel a little less annoyed at myself for getting distracted. Everything here has been cultivated for my own pleasure, outside of working hours. Hope you find something interesting&#33;</p> <h2 id=2023 ><a href="#2023" class=header-anchor >2023</a></h2> <h3 id=january ><a href="#january" class=header-anchor >January</a></h3> <p><strong>&#91;10&#93;</strong> Initial commit? Today was a bit of a low level day. I learnt about the foreign function interface capabilities of both OCaml and Rust. <label for=sn-ffi-ocaml  class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox  id=sn-ffi-ocaml  class=margin-toggle /> <span class=sidenote > "Foreign Function Interface", <em>Real World Ocaml</em>, 405-414</span> <label for=sn-ffi-ocaml  class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox  id=sn-ffi-ocaml  class=margin-toggle /> <span class=sidenote > "Communicating with the OS", <em>Exploring Async Basics with Rust</em></span></p> <p>I was also interested in the Unix filesystem so I looked through how file tables were organized – looks like it&#39;s linked lists all the way down. I read the paper &#40;?&#41; that lays the groundwork for the <em>kqueue&#40;2&#41;</em> event notification system.<label for=sn-kqueue-paper  class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type=checkbox  id=sn-kqueue-paper  class=margin-toggle /> Finally, I dabbled a little bit into using ARM assembly to make syscalls.
