My name is Tazmilur Saad -- most people call me Taz, for short. I went to Colgate University where I studied computer
science and applied mathematics. I am currently a software engineer in the financial industry at Barclays. 

Previously, I was also a research assistant with the Colgate biology department focusing on statistical analysis and stochastic kinetic simulation, although my current research aspirations have migrated towards programming language theory.

I'm a big proponent of Rust, OCaml and $\LaTeX$. I also enjoy cooking, horror films and tabletop role playing games. Lastly, I am a diehard fan of Carly Rae Jepsen's music :)

Sincerely, \\
Taz (he/him)
