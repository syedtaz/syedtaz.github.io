My name is Tazmilur Saad -- most people call me Taz, for short. I recently graduated from Colgate University double majoring in computer
science and applied mathematics.

I am currently a software engineer at Barclays. As a research assistant, I have also worked on multiple projects for the Colgate biology department mostly focusing on statistical analysis, machine learning and stochastic kinetic simulation.

I'm a big fan of functional programming and $\LaTeX$. I also enjoy cooking, horror films and tabletop role playing games.

Sincerely, \\
Taz (he/him)
