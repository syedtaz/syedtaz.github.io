<h1>( Tazmilur Saad )</h1>

<p>Most people call me Taz. I went to Colgate University where I studied computer
  science and applied mathematics. I am currently a software engineer at Barclays investment bank.</p>

<p>In a past life I liked machine learning and statistical analysis, but these days I spend my
  time on the internals of programming languages and all sorts of type tetris. I
  watch a lot of horror movies, play a bunch of tabletop RPGs and listen to Carly Rae Jepsen.
