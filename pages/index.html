<h1>(* Tazmilur Saad *)</h1>

<p>Most people call me Taz. I went to Colgate University where I studied computer
  science and applied mathematics. I am currently a software engineer at Barclays investment bank
  where I work on data-intensive systems.
</p>

<p>I spend a lot of my time on the internals of programming languages. In a past life I liked machine learning and statistical analysis.
  I also watch a lot of horror movies, play a bunch of tabletop RPGs and listen to Carly Rae Jepsen.
